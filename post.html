                    <p>500 years ago, having a fever could mean the difference between life and death, nowadays; a simple prescription will make your fever go away in a day. Women had a 50% or more chance of dying during childbirth, now it is a fraction of that. Sending messages to the other side of the world would take months, now reduced to seconds. Travelling took years, with a high chance of dying on the way, now we travel with leisure and watch a movie on the way. Truly, many would agree it is far better to live in the present than in the past, but is the rate of technological advancements moving too fast? Without a doubt technology has made many things more convenient. You need only Google something to see the benefit. Itâ€™s also made it possible for more people to find work and helped to create countless businesses. But is there too much technology for our own good?</p>

                    <p>Everyday there always seems to be some new technology around the corner; it would be fair to assume that technology is moving very fast. We, that human race have advanced more in the last 100 years than the last thousand. However, we must also see what areas we need to improve on, not only just with electronics or gadgets, but in other fields of technology such as medicine, astrology and even in our way of thinking about technology.</p>

                    <p>Our medical technology has advanced and continues to advance at a rapid rate; we now know a lot more about the human body than we did before. We can easily treat or prevent disease. But, we have only ever successfully eliminated two diseases, namely, Smallpox and Rinderpest, which is an incredible achievement and needs to be done more frequently in order to save more lives. The ongoing mistrust and campaign against medicine and vaccinations have had an effect on the advancing our medicines as instead of the funding of new medicines and vaccines, the medicinal community is wasting money on proving time and time again that the dangers of vaccination are unfounded and is not true.</p>

                    <p>Space Exploration used to be a very exciting thing to the general public. People were glued to their televisions when footage of the moon landing was released to the public. Organizations such as NASA have dedicated billions of dollars in an attempt to learn more and explore the vast universe in which we live in. In the present time, a new discovery regarding space has been met with mostly indifference from the public as they most likely do not see the importance of these discoveries. This, in turn, has led to organizations like NASA losing funding and moving slower than they ever have in the realms of space exploration.</p>

                    <p>So, is technology moving too fast? I believe it is not moving fast enough and is actually slowing down in favor of more commercial advancements to be used for entertainment purposes. I believe that the majority of the human race is slowing down the advancement of technology due to the hostile view of technology rooted in their traditional superstitions and belief. The spread of misinformation also plays a factor in this and humanity needs to align its understanding of technology to the rate of its advancements, because that is what holding technology back, a lack of understanding and interest. We must learn to be more open-minded and think of the future of our race if we are to make any progress.</p>
